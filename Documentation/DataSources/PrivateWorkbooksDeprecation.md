# Private Workbooks Deprecation
The ability to save workbooks as Private Workbooks is going away by the end of 2020. You will still be able to access your private workbooks but any edit or save can only be saved as a Shared Workbook. 

# Why? 
There are several inconsistencies with the private workbook type that cause issues and confusion. 

# How should you proceed?
If you choose to migrate your private workbook to a shared one, you can go to your private workbook and click "Save As" and select the "Shared Report" option from the drop down. If you don't want others to have access to your workbook, you can always manually change the RBAC to deny access to others.
