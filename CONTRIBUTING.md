## How to contribute
We follow the [GitHub shared repository model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models).


Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

- [Commit messages](#commit-messages)
- [Pull requests](#pull-requests)


## Creating issues
- You can [create an issue][new-issue], but before doing that please read the bullets below and include as many details as possible.
- Perform a [cursory search][issue-search] to see if a similar issue has already been submitted.

### Related repositories

## Recommended setup for contributing
- Get contributor access

  In order to contribute, you'll need contributor access to the repo in order to push your branch and create a PR. If you are a Microsoft employee, mail `azmonworkbooks`  to be added as a contributor. If you are not a Microsoft employee, the quickest way is to [create a new issue][new-issue] and ask for contributor access.

- To contribute your own examples, clone the repo, [create a new branch](#topic-branch), make your changes or additions, and then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). 

- If you submit a pull request with new or significant changes, and you are not an employee of Microsoft, we'll add a comment to the pull request asking you to submit an online [CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com) (Contribution License Agreement). We'll need you to complete the online form before we can accept your pull request.

- If you are adding new folders to the top level Workbooks folder, you should also update the CODEOWNERS file to assign people from your team as owners of content in that folder. This will allow github to automatically require review from people in your team in order to update your templates.

For details of how to contribute templates, see the [template contribution](Documentation/Contributing.md) documentation

## Commit messages
When creating commits, always try to create useful commit messages explaining what that commit contains. Avoid commit messages like "fix" or "commit". If you're fixing something that's been reported as an issue in the repo, refer to the issue number in commit messages.

## Pull Requests
When creating a pull request, please create a good title, fill the description with content, and ideally, paste a screenshot of what your template looks like when used as a workbook. Not everyone may have access to the type of data you have in your workbook, so seeing a screenshot of what is expected is often helpful, especially for complicated workbooks.

In general, the workbooks team will *not* complete or merge PRs for other teams unless explicitly told to do so.
After your pull request is approved and merged, please delete your branch.

The github pull request will verify you've signed the CLA agreement, and that your code passes a set of CI build tests.

## Build and Deployment
After a PR is completed to the `master` branch, an [official build is queued](https://github-private.visualstudio.com/microsoft/_build?definitionId=48) (you might not have access to this), which packages all the templates up into a cacheable format for deployment. This build generally takes ~15 minutes.

After the official build completes, [a staged release deployment takes place to ](https://github-private.visualstudio.com/microsoft/_release?_a=releases&definitionId=1) (again, you might not have access to this), which takes ~15 minutes to work its way through all the stages.

So in the usual case, after successful completion of a PR and deployment, template changes become available in ~30 minutes.
