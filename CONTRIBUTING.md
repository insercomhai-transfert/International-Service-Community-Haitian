## Recommended setup for contributing
- Get contributor access

  In order to contribute, you'll need contributor access to the repo in order to push your branch and create a PR. If you are a Microsoft employee, mail `azmonworkbooks`  to be added as a contributor. If you are not a Microsoft employee, the quickest way is to [create a new issue][new-issue] and ask for contributor access.

- To contribute your own examples, clone the repo, [create a new branch](#topic-branch), make your changes or additions, and then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). When creating a pull request, please create a good title, fill the description with content, and ideally, paste a screenshot of what your template looks like when used as a workbook.

- If you submit a pull request with new or significant changes, and you are not an employee of Microsoft, we'll add a comment to the pull request asking you to submit an online [CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com) (Contribution License Agreement). We'll need you to complete the online form before we can accept your pull request.
